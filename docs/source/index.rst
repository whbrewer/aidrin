AIDRIN Documentation
====================

**AIDRIN** (AI Data Readiness Infrastructure) is an open-source tool designed to streamline the preparation and evaluation of datasets for artificial intelligence and machine learning workflows. AIDRIN enables researchers, data scientists, and developers to assess the quality, structure, and readiness of datasets through an intuitive, browser-based interface.

AIDRIN evaluates datasets across six dimensions:

- **Data Quality**
- **Data Governance**
- **Data Understandability and Usability**
- **Fairness and Bias**
- **Impact on AI**
- **Data Structure and Organization**

Three Ways to Use AIDRIN
------------------------

**Web Interface**
   An interactive, browser-based dashboard. Upload a dataset, select dimensions and metrics, and
   explore results with visualizations and downloadable reports — no coding required. Available
   hosted at `aidrin.io <https://aidrin.io>`_ or self-hosted locally.
   See :ref:`web_installation` and :ref:`web_usage`.

**Command Line Interface (CLI)**
   Run data readiness metrics directly from your terminal or Python scripts. Suitable for
   automated pipelines, CI workflows, and headless environments. Also includes an **agentic
   evaluation** component for domain-aware data readiness question answering and remediation
   grounded in scientific literature.
   See :ref:`cli_installation` and :ref:`cli_usage`.

**Claude Code (MCP)**
   Ask Claude Code to assess your dataset in plain language. AIDRIN ships an MCP server
   (``aidrin-mcp``) and a Claude Code skill that together let Claude run metrics, interpret
   results, and write a readiness report — with no commands to remember.
   See :ref:`aidrin_skill`.
